Good morning/afternoon, I am delighted to take part in this interview. My name is Shiziqi, come from Tianjin University and major in the Computer Science and Technology program.

I obtained a score of 531 on the CET-6 and was awarded provincial scholarships twice. Furthermore, I actively participated in research, accumulating three research experiences, one of which involved submitting research findings as the primary author to NeurIPS 2024. I also took part in the Robomaster competition and led the vision team. XX University has always been a revered institution for me, and if granted the opportunity to attend, I will put in my utmost effort. Thank you very much for your attention.


# 爱好


Volleyball is my preferred pastime. During high school, I would engage in the sport for about an hour daily to unwind, and continued playing once or twice a week in college. It serves as a way for me to stay active and shed some pounds, while also allowing me to reminisce about the fond memories from my high school days.
