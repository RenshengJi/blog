# 英语面试


## 自我介绍


Good morning/afternoon, I am delighted to take part in this interview. My name is Shiziqi, come from Tianjin University and major in the Computer Science and Technology program. Throughout my undergraduate studies, I dedicated myself to my academics and achieved the third position in my major. I obtained a score of 531 on the CET-6 and was awarded provincial scholarships twice. Furthermore, I actively participated in research, accumulating three research experiences, one of which involved submitting research findings as the primary author to NeurIPS 2024. I also took part in the Robomaster competition and led the vision team. XX University has always been a revered institution for me, and if granted the opportunity to attend, I will put in my utmost effort. Thank you very much for your attention.


## 爱好


I enjoy playing volleyball as my favorite hobby. In high school, I play it an hour every day to relax, and I continued playing once or twice a week in college. It helps me stay active, lose weight, and brings back memories from my high school days.


## 科研经历


Continual Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA) is an emerging and challenging task where a model trained in a source domain must adapt to continuously changing conditions during testing, without access to the original source data. CTTA is prone to error accumulation due to uncontrollable domain shifts, leading to blurred decision boundaries between categories. Existing CTTA methods primarily focus on suppressing domain shifts, which proves inadequate during the unsupervised test phase.
In contrast, we introduce a novel approach that guides rather than suppresses these shifts.
Specifically, we propose ***C***ontrollable ***Co***ntinual ***T***est-***T***ime ***A***daptation (C-CoTTA), which explicitly prevents any single category from encroaching on others, thereby mitigating the mutual influence between categories caused by uncontrollable shifts. 
Moreover, our method reduces the sensitivity of model to domain transformations, thereby minimizing the magnitude of category shifts. 
Extensive quantitative experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, while qualitative analyses, such as t-SNE plots, confirm the theoretical validity of our approach. Our code is available at github.
